========================================================

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

The Python library for YAML was started by Steve Howell in 
February 2002.  Steve is the primary author of the project,
but others have contributed.  See the README for more on 
the project.  The term "PyYaml" refers to the entire 
distribution of this library, including examples, documentation,
and test files, as well as the core implementation.

This library is intended for general use, and the license 
below protects the "open source" nature of the library.  The 
license does, however, allow for use of the library in 
commercial applications as well, subject to the terms 
and conditions listed.  The license below is a minor 
rewrite of the Python 2.2 license, with no substantive 
differences.
